## Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Shanil, and I build, break and fix stuff in the clouds. I work on **AWS** and **Azure**, occasionally like to tinker with **GCP** I don't take any sides as I see every cloud as equal ðŸ¥‡

### A little about me:
I've been with Cloudreach since March 2019, working in the Public Cloud space as Cloud Developer/Engineer in varying sectors such as Public Sector (UK Govt), UK Financial Services, Oil & Gas and Freight and Logistics. 

Prior to joining Cloudreach, I've spent most of my career within Managed Services Providers (MSPs) in varying business verticals such as Technical Support, Operations and Delivery/Professional Services and  held roles as an Infrastructure Specialist, Cloud Delivery Consultant and Cloud Operations Engineer, working with a wide range of industry standard products and services from Private to Public Cloud.

### How long have I been doing things in IT:
- Overall 10 Years but a little over 4.5 in Cloud/Devops

### What I've learned along the way:
- Public Cloud (AWS, Azure & GCP) 
- Infra as Code (Terraform & Cloudformation)
- Configuration Management (Packer & Ansible)
- Shell/Scripting (Bash and PoSH)
- CI/CD (Github, Gitlab and even Jenkins)
- SysAdmin (Windows) and VirtualAdmin (VMWare, Hyper-V)
