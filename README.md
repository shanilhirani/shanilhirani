## Hello, Hi! üëã

I'm a **Senior Consultant** with over a **decade** of experience, having worked across multiple sectors including the **Public Sector (UK Gov)**, **UK Financial Services**, **Energy**, and **Logistics** across **Cloud Infrastructure**, **Platform Engineering** and **Solutions Architecture**. 

My passion is helping teams and individuals navigate the ever-evolving world of cloud computing, automating infrastructure, and building scalable, reliable solutions. 

### üöÄ What I Do

I design, build, and guide others on their **cloudy journey**‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs scaling apps, automating workflows, or deploying infrastructure. While I remain **cloud-agnostic**, I‚Äôm particularly fond of working with **AWS** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, though I‚Äôve been known to tinker with **Azure** when needed.

### üõ†Ô∏è Skills and Tools of the Trade

Over the years, I've built a versatile skill set across multiple tools and platforms, allowing me to adapt to different environments and challenges:

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation 
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible, Packer, Chef, Puppet  
- **Scripting and Automation**: Bash, PowerShell, Python and Golang  
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins  
- **Systems Administration**: Windows Server, RHEL
- **Virtualisation** VMWare, Hyper-V, Proxmox, KVM
- **Containerisation**: Docker, Kubernetes

### ‚è≥ My Journey in Tech

I've been immersed in the world of technology for **over a decade**. During that time, I‚Äôve worn many hats‚Äîfrom traditional sysadmin roles to cloud-native engineering. Today, I specialise in **Cloud, DevOps, and Automation**‚Äîhelping organizations embrace modern cloud infrastructure and streamline operations with smart automation techniques.

### üå± Continuous Learning

The cloud is always evolving, and I‚Äôm constantly learning new ways to design more efficient, scalable systems. Whether it‚Äôs the latest advancements in serverless architecture, multi-cloud strategies, or container orchestration‚ÄîI‚Äôm all about continuous improvement.
