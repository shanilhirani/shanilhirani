## Hello, Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

### A little about me:
**TLDR**: I'm Shanil, and I build, break and fix stuff in the clouds. 

I've been working in the Public Cloud space as Cloud Developer/Engineer in varying sectors such as Public Sector (UK Govt), UK Financial Services, Oil & Gas and Freight and Logistics. 
I build, break and fix on **AWS** and **Azure**, occasionally like to tinker with **GCP**.

### How long have I been doing things in IT:
- Professionally, ~10 years but a little over 4.5 years in the Cloud/Devops Space

### What I've learned along the way:
- Public Cloud (AWS, Azure & GCP) 
- Infra as Code (Terraform & Cloudformation)
- Configuration Management (Packer & Ansible)
- Shell/Scripting (Bash and PoSH)
- CI/CD (Github, Gitlab and even Jenkins)
- SysAdmin (Windows) and VirtualAdmin (VMWare, Hyper-V)
